## Description 
Caesar ciphers are simple substitution ciphers in which each letter in the text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions up or down the alphabet. The user can then in a swing GUI enter a text theyâ€™d like to decode and choose the number of step back or forward, and the decoded message appears in the window. In order to solve the problem of what to do at the begninig and end of the alphabet as would in a standard list, a circular list was built from scarch using the util package in Java. 

The `CircularList` class has an internal static `IndNode` class. CircularList has two IndNode attributes, `head` and `tail`. CircularList has a `` method for allowing for creating a circular alphabet list through the addition of IndNode nodes, and a `` method for disphering a word (method), by extracting the next value in the circular list (method) or the prvious value (method). The word to be diphered is provided by the user in a swing GUI, as well as the number of shift steps and the direction of shift.
